# tide-compress

Outgoing body compression middleware for the [Tide][] server framework.

```rust
#[async_std::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = tide::new();
    app.with(tide_compress::CompressMiddleware::new());
}
```

## Features

- Support for [Brotli][], [Gzip][], and [Deflate][] encodings, compile-time configurable through cargo feature flags.
  - Prioritizes Brotli if available.
  - Only pulls in the necessary dependencies for the desired configuration.
  - Defaults to Brotli & Gzip.
  - Also handles the `"identity"` encoding directive [as per RFC 9110][Identity].
- [`Accept-Encoding`][] header checking including priority.
- Minimum body size threshold (Default: 1024 bytes, configurable).
- Does not compress responses with a [`Cache-Control: no-transform`][] header.
- Sets the [`Vary`][] header.
- Checks the [`Content-Type`][] header (MIME).
  - Checks against [jshttp's comprehensive database][jshttp mime-db], which is compiled to a [perfect hash function][] at build time.
  - If not in the database, checks against a regular expression.
    - Default: `^text/|\+(?:json|text|xml)$` (case insensitive).
    - Fully override-able to any custom [`Regex`][], with `None` as an option.
  - Functionality can be excluded in crate features if the `regex` crate or codegen poses build issues.

## Note

This crate, in its current set up with the `db-check` feature enabled (which is by default),
pulls down [a json MIME database][jshttp mime-db] from the network at build time.
