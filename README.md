# tide-compress

Outgoing compression middleware for the [Tide][] server framework.

```rust
#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -> tide::Result {
    let mut app = tide::new();
    app.with(tide_compress::CompressMiddleware::new());
}
```

## Features

- Support for Brotli, Gzip, and Deflate encodings, compile-time configurable through cargo feature flags.
  - Prioritizes Brotli if available.
  - Only pulls in the necessary dependencies for the desired configuration.
  - Defaults to Brotli + Gzip.
- `Accept-Encoding` checking including priority.
- Minimum body size threshold.
  - Configurable when created by `CompressMiddleware::with_threshold(usize)`.
- Does not compress responses with a [`Cache-Control: no-transform`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.
- Sets the [`Vary`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary) header.

## Caveats

- Does not do any `Content-Type` / MIME checking.
